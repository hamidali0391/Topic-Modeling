# Topic-Modeling

This repository will use Udacity's Natural Language Processing Nanodegree's LDA for Topic Modeling project as a baseline and build on that.

## Experiment 1: 
Topic Modeling for new articles with headers "publish_date" and "headline_text". If the data is structured differently then preprocessing needs to be modified.
